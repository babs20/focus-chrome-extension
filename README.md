# focus-chrome-extension

## Summary

Sometimes working on the computer can be a blessing and a curse. Your brain says, "I am just gonna check this for a minute.", and the next thing you know, you have been procrastinating for hours. My goal with this project is to practice Javascript and Web Development, while also creating a barrier from these websites, with specific criteria in order to unlock them once my work has been completed.

These type of extensions exist, so I am mainly doing this for educational / research purposes.

## Main Goals (MVP)

1. Block distracting websites during working hours. (10AM - 4PM) _ex. (Twitter and Twitch)_.
2. Create a basic criteria for the block to be removed _ex. (Github Updated, Time Period, etc.)_.
3. Make it annoying to manually disable it, but still possible for edge cases.
